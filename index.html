</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project created for P2 of EECS494. Design and build a game from scratch. I decided on a Puzzle Platformer game
        becuase I really wanted to focus in on level design for this project. The relatively "easy" mechanics gave me more
        time to really work on the non-technical aspects like player learning and level creation.

</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project created for P3 of EECS494. Design and build a game from scratch. 

        Bunker Bros is a cooperative survival game where two players are protecting their bunker entrance from the zombie
        onslaught. One person controls a drone from above supporting a remote-controlled robot on the ground as they work
        together to fight off endless waves of zombies. Activate five radio towers scattered across the map to call for help and
        outlast one last wave of zombies before the military arrives.

        I developed:
        <li>
            Almost all of the UI for both the player and manager.
            Enemy AI by using Unity's built-in NavMesh.
            Hover system for the manager
            Health Bars + Damage indications
            Turning on Radio Towers
            etc.
        </li>

    <li>Technology: C#, Unity, Photoshop, Premiere Pro</li>
