        Project created for P2 of EECS494. Design and build a game from scratch. I decided on a Puzzle Platformer game
        becuase I really wanted to focus in on level design for this project. The relatively "easy" mechanics gave me more
        time to really work on the non-technical aspects like player learning and level creation.
